    Intuition:
        We simply traverse the graph iteratively by storing the node as well as the

        whenever we process the node's children, we can check if they are good or
        not by comparing their respective value to the maxVal in the path.
        We can also then compute the new maxVal in the path and continue
        until we have processed all nodes in the tree.
