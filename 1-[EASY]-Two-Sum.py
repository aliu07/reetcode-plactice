    Intuition:
        Rather than brute forcing, we can store number in a hashmap and
        simply perform a lookup for subsequent numbers to see if the
        difference between the target number and the current number is
        contained within the hashmap

    Notes:
        We need to return the indices in order. Since we iterate from left
        to right, we know that if target - num is in the map, then the index
        associated will be smaller by default.
