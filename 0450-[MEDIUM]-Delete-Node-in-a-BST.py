    Intuition:
        Searching for the existence of the key value in a BST is trivial. The hard part
        of this problem is figuring out how to delete the target node if found. Mainly,
        we need to keep in mind the properties of a BST: every element in the left
        subtree has to be lesser than the current node and every element in the right
        subtree has to be greater than the current node.

        With these properties in mind, we realize intuitively that we need to rotate
        in a node that preserves them. Simply, we can choose the smallest element in
        the right subtree to take the place of our deleted node. By doing so, we still
        guarantee that every element in the left subtree will be smaller, but also that
        every element in the right subtree will be greater than the new node's value.

    Runtime:
        In the worst case, our tree will be skewed (i.e. a linked list) and so the
        runtiem will be O(n). However, the average runtime will be O(log n) or the
        height of the BST.

    Memory:
        Each recursive call takes memory on the call stack. We have one call per
        level of the BST, so the total number of calls represents the height of the
        tree. In the worst case, the tree is skewed which gives a memory complexity
        of O(n). On average, we will have O(log n) calls.
