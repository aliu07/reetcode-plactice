    Intuition:
        We use a max heap to keep track of the greatest element in the current window.
        We store tuples that contain the value as well as its index within our heap.
        Whenever we update out window, we check the root of our max heap to see if it
        is still valid. If the index is less than the left index (r - k + 1), then we
        pop it. Continue this process until our new max is valid (i.e. it falls within
        the current window).

    Runtime:
        Each element in the input array is processed once which gives us O(n). For each
        element, it is pushed onto the heap at most once and popped from it at most once
        as well. Pushing onto the heap takes O(log k) time since the heap has size k.
        Popping from the heap also takes O(log k) time. Therefore, the overall time
        complexity is O(n * log k). Since k = n in the worst case, then our new overall
        complexity becomes O(n * log n)

    Memory:
        We need to store a heap of size k which brings our overall memory complexity to
        O(k). Once again, since k = n in the worst case, we have O(n) as our new overall
        space complexity.
