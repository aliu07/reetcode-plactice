class Solution:
    """
    Intuition:
        The problem can be broken down into two steps. In the first step, we can extend
        the LL by inserting duplicate nodes for each existing node. We can then think of
        the LL as pairs of (original, dupliate) node pairings.

        Then, the second step involves setting the random pointer of the duplicate nodes
        and breaking the LL down into its original and deep copy.

    Runtime:
        O(n) to make duplicates of each node in the LL.

        O(n) to weave the copy list

        Overall, O(n) runtime for the entire solution.

    Memory:
        O(1) auxiliary memory used (excluding the memory allocated for the deep copy).
