    Intuition:
        Use a fixed sliding window of size k. We are given in the
        constraints that there are at least k elements in the input
        array, so we start the current sum of the first k elements.

        We track sums instead of averages since the max average is a
        reflection of the max sum. At each iteration, we modify the
        current sum by subtracting the leftmost element and adding the
        rightmost element (new number).
