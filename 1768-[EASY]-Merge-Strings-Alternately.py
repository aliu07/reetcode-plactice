        Similar to merge 2 sorted linked lists problem. Use 2 pointers
        and iterate through both strings while building result. At the

        Same approach as solution 1. Just wanted to write a working solution

    Notes:
        Runtime is on same scale, but a lot slower... probably due to overhead
