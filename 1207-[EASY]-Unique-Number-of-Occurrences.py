    Intuition:
        We create a hashmap to compute the frequence of each element in the input array. Then,
        we use a set to track the number of unique occurrences/frequencies. If we find a duplicate,
        we return false.

    Runtime:
        O(n). We need one pass to build the frequency hashmap and another to check if each
        frequency is unique.

    Memory:
        O(n) since we need to store a hashmap and a hashset.
