    Intuition:
        Standard multi-source BFS question. The only key observation is
        that our termination condition for BFS is either when there is
        nothing left to process in the queue or if we ran out of fresh
        oranges to rot.

    Runtime: O(m * n) -> bounded by finding rotten orange sources.

    Memory: O(m * n)
