    Intuition:
        Since the input size constraint is not too large (s.len <= 1000), we
        can deduce that this is an O(n^2) soln.

        Thus, one approach would be to take all possible starting indices and
        check them against all subarrays starting at that given index.

        We can use a frequency array with 26 elmts and increment the count of
        each letter. If we increment from 0, we know we encountered a distinct
        letter. If the current frequency we incremented is greater than all
        other frequencies, we change `maxFreq` accordingly. `maxFreq` allows
        us to check if our subarray is balanced or not.

    Runtime:
        O(n^2) to compute each subarray.

    Memory:
        O(1).
