    Intuition:
        Use a max heap to track distances. Since we have
        a max heap, the point with the highest distance
        will be at the root. Thus, if we need to evict,
        we can simply just pop the root.

    Runtime:
        Each point processed once, push/pop operations take
        O(log k) time. Overall O(n log k) time.

        Since k < n, it would be more advantageous if we can
        apply the log factor on n instead of k. O(k log n)
        runtime is possible with a min-heap.

    Memory:
        O(k) for the heap.
