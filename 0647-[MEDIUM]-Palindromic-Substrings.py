        is that a palindrome can either be even in length or odd. We
        iterate through every index of the input string and search for both
        even and odd palindromes.

    Notes:
        There exists a DP approach too that is covered in the solution below.

    Intuition:
        Finding palindromes is something that satisfies the conditions for a
        DP solution well. We have the optimal substructure property where a
        larger substring is palindromic only if the smaller substring composing
        it is palindromic too. It also satisfies the overlapping subproblems
        property since subproblems are repeatedly used to solve overlaps.

    Notes:
        Requires more memory than previous solution

        Also runs slower due to requiring an extra pass to build base cases.

        Can optimize by breaking from checking subproblems as soon as
        2 different characters are encountered.
