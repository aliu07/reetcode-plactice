    Intuition:
        We can think of traversing the rooms as a classic DFS problem. The keys represent
        the nodes since we need a key to travel to a specific room. At the end, simply check
        if the number of visited rooms is equal to the total number of rooms.

    Runtime:
        O(|V| + |E|) where |V| is the number of rooms and |E| is the number of "edges"
        represented as keys here.

    Memory: O(n) where n is the number of nodes i.e. keys.

    Notes:
        Constraints specify at least 2 rooms, so we don't need to check that the length
        of the rooms array is 0.
