    Intuition:
        Instead of starting from the middle and checking if each cell can
        reach both oceans, we simply compute the reachability starting from
        each respective ocean and then compute the final result by taking
        taking the overlap from both Atlantic and Pacific matrices.

    Runtime:
        O(m * n) -> Need to process each cell once.

    Memory:
        O(m * n) -> Store boolean results in equal M x N matrices.
