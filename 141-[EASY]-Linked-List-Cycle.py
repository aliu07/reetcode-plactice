    Intuition:
        Use 2 pointers, 1 travels fast (jump 2 nodes per iter), the
        other travels slow (only jumps 1 node per iter). If ever they
        meet, that means we have a cycle. Otherwise, if one reaches
        the end of the linked list, then we know we do not have any
        cycles.

    Runtime:
        O(n) since we need to traverse the linked list

    Memory:
        O(1) since we are only storing pointers
