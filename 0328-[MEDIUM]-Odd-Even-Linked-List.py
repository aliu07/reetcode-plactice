    Intuition:
        We use 2 pointers to iterate through odd and even nodes separately.
        We also need to store a pointer to the head of the odd and even linked
        lists.

        The trickiest part for me was determining the loop condition for the
        while block. However, after some thought, you realize that even is
        the rightmost pointer at any moment in the list (i.e. nearest to the
        end). Therefore, we just iterate until we exast the next even node.

    Runtime:
        O(n) -> one pass

    Memory:
        O(1) -> only using pointers and rearranging existing pointers
