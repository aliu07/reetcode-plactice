class Solution:
    """
    Intuition:
        We are given 2 possible operations:
            1) Swap any two existing characters in a word
            2) Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing
               character, and do the same with the other character.

        What does this mean for us? It means that 2 strings are close as long as every
        character in word1 also exists in word2 and the frequencies (occurrences of each
        character) match up.

    Runtime:
        O(n) since we need to build the hashsets and frequence counting arrays.

    Memory:
        O(n) to store the hashsets and arrays.

    Notes:
        The runtime of this solution is very slow on the LeetCode platform. We can rely on
        built-in data structures to accelerate our performance significantly.
