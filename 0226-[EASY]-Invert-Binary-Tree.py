    Intuition:
        Use a recursive approach. We process each node and
        recursively call the function on its children.

    Runtime:
        Need to process each node to invert children, so
        runtime of O(n).

    Memory:
        O(1) auxiliary space, so constant memory solution.

        Although note that call stack is O(log n) in the
        best case for a balanced binary tree (root to leaf
        path is log n) and O(n) in the worst case for an
        unbalanced tree.

    Memory:
        We removed the need for a call stack since the
        solution is not recursive anymore.
