    Intuition:
        We generate the cycle of row numbers to iterate through. For example, if we have 3 rows, the cycle would
        array would contain [0, 1, 2, 1]. This way, we can use modulo math to increment the index when traversing
        the cycle array to wrap around and come back to 0 after the last 1.

        Then, we use this logic and traverse the input string to feed each character into their appropriate row.
        After than, we simply concatenate everything.

    Runtime:
        O(N) where N is the length of the input string since we need to traverse it to assign each char and then
        concatenate everything.

    Memory:
        O(N) as well since each character of the input string needs to be stored in a row array.

class Solution2:

    Intuition:
        We can optimize our previous solution by realizing 2 things:

        1) If the numRows is 1 or if the length of the input string is less than or equal to the number
        of rows, then we can return the string as is.

        2) Instead of building a cycle array to hold the row numbers, we can use a direction variable 'dir'
        that will act as an incrementor. It can either be +1 or -1. We manage this dir variable according
        to the current row's value.
