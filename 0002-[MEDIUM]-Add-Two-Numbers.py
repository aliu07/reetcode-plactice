    Intuition:
        If you have ever done binary addition, the solution is straightforward. We keep track
        of the carry and iterate so long as we either have node values in l1, l2 or have
        carry-over we need to account for.

    Runtime:
        O(n) where n is the length of the longest linked list between l1 and l2.

    Memory:
        O(n) to store the resulting linked list. Technically O(1) auxiliary space.
