    Intuition:
        Anagrams have the property where the frequency of their letters
        are identical. We just need to hash that property somehow. One
        way to achieve this is to compute the frequency of each letter
        as an array. We then cast that array to a tuple since dictionaries
        in Python require the key to be immutable.

    Runtime:
        O(N * K) where N is the length of the input array strs and K is
        the length of the longest string present in the array.

    Memory:
        O(N * K) with similar reasonning to runtime.
