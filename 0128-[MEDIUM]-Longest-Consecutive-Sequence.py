    Intuition:
        A sequence always starts with a number and ends with a number.
        In our case, we are trying to isolate a consecutive sequence. The
        idea is to find the starting number of a sequence and iterate
        until we exhaust it.

        Our starting condition is essentially to check if the number
        previous to it is in the hash set. If it is not, it is a potential
        starter to a sequence.

        O(n) -> One pass to hash all nums, one pass to find longest streak.

        O(n) -> Need hashset to store all nums in input array.
