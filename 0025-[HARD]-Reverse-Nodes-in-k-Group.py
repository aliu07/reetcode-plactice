    Intuition:
        We will start with a brute force approach. We transform the linked list into
        an array so we can process it sequentially more efficiently.

       We start by iterating over windows of size k. If the window size is less than
       k, we break. Otherwise, we reverse the elements.

       Then, we reconstruct the linked list given the processed array.

    Runtime:
        O(n) to transform the linked list into array form.

        O(n) to reverse the k-groups in the array.

        O(n) to rebuild the linked list.

        Overall runtime is O(n).

    Memory:
        O(n) to store the nodes in an array.
