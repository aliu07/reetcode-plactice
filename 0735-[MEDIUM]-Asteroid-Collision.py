    Intuition:
        We use a stack to maintain state of asteroids. Notice that we only need
        to perform collision detection whenever we encounter an asteroid traveling
        towards the left.

    Notes:
        SO MANY SUBCASES... surely there's a better way of writing this...

    Runtime: O(n)
        Because every asteroid is only added to the stack once and potentially
        popped once despite the inner while loop seeming expensive.
