    Intuition:
        We use a dynamic sliding window technique. The keywords here are longest
        which implies optimization and substring which implies a contiguous
        substructure in the provided input string.

        We keep a hashset to track the current characters in a substring. As
        soon as we encounter a duplicate, we increment the left pointer until
        the duplicate character is removed.

    Runtime:
        O(n) -> one pass

    Memory:
        O(n) -> hashset contains at most all chars in input string
