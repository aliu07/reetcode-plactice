    Intuition:
        We binary-search a partition on the SHORTER array so that the total number of elements
        on the left side across both arrays is half of the combined length.

        For a candidate cut A[:midA+1] | A[midA+1:] in A, we choose B’s matching cut so that
        left sizes add to half: midB = half - midA - 2. When the largest left elements
        (maxLeftA, maxLeftB) are both ≤ the smallest right elements (minRightA, minRightB), the
        split is correct.

        The median is then either the min of the right-side mins (odd total) or the average
        of the max left and min right (even total). Using −inf/+inf handles edge cuts cleanly.

    Runtime:
        O(log(min(m, n))) — we only binary-search over the shorter array’s indices.

    Memory:
        O(1) — constant extra space; we only keep a few pointers and boundary values.
