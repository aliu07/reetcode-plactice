    Intuition:
        We process the binary tree layer by layer. We go from right to left and use the 'prev' ptr
        to store the next pointer for the subsequent node.

    Runtime:
        O(n) -> We need to process each node once and set its next pointer.

    Memory:
        O(n) -> O(w) where w is the width of the largest layer. Here, it's the deepest layer since we
        are dealing with a perfect binary tree. Since the deepest layer contains roughly half the nodes
        of the tree, we can simplify O(n/2) to O(n).
