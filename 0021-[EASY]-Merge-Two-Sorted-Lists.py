    Intuition:
        We can iterate through both lists to create the new list. At the end, we simply
        exhaust list1 or list2 in case their lengths are not equal.

        We use a dummy node here to be able to return the head of the merged list
        efficiently.

    Runtime:
        O(n) since we need to traverse both lists.

    Memory:
        O(n) to build the merged list, but technically O(1) auxiliary space.
