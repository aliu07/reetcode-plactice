    Intuition:
        We can use 2 pointers to traverse each substring. However, we need to
        take into account odd and even palindromes. Thus, at each index, we
        need to check both cases.

    Runtime:
        O(n) -> consider the case where the substring is of the same length
        as the input string.

    Memory:
        O(1) -> we're only manipulating pointers.
