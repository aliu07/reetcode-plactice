    Intuition:
        We somehow want to build the sorted order of the BST so that
        we can peek the kth smallest element in constant time. We can
        use in-order traversal to achieve this.

        This solution takes a recursive approach.

    Runtime:
        Each node needs to be processed and inserted into the inOrder
        array, so O(n) time.

    Memory:
        O(h) for recursive call stack where h is the height of the tree.
        O(log n) best case, O(n) worst case with an unbalanced tree.

        O(n) for the array.

        Overall O(n) memory.

class Solution2:
    """
    Intuition:
        We can make our algorithm slightly more memory efficient by
        removing the inOrder array.

        Instead, we store k in a nonlocal var and decrement it. Once
        it hits 0, we know we hit our kth smallest elmt so that beocmes
        our result.

        This solution still takes a recursive approach.

    Runtime:
        O(n) -> same as Solution1.

    Memory:
        Removed the need for the array, but call stack is still
        O(n) in the worst case.

        Overall, O(n) memory.
