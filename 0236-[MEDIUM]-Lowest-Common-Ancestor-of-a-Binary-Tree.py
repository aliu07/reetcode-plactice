    """
    Intuition:
        We solve this problem in 3 steps:

        1. Find all the parent relations of all nodes in the tree. We can
        terminate this step early if we have seen both p and q.

        2. Build a hashset containing all the ancestors of p.

        3. Iterate over the ancestors of q until we hit a common one with p.

    Runtime:
        Each node is processed at most once to define their parent mapping.
        In the worst case, we need to process all nodes before p and q are
        processed, leading to O(n) time.

        Fetching all the ancestors of p into a hashset takes O(n) at worst.

        Iterating over q until we hit a common ancestor also take O(n) time
        at worst.

        Overall, O(n) time.

    Memory:
        Stack takes up at most O(h) where h is height of tree. In best
        case, h is log n where n is the number of nodes. In the worst
        case, h is n if we have an unbalanced tree.

        The parent hashmap takes up linear space.

        Overall O(n).
