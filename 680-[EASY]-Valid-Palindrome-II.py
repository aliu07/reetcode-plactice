    Intuition:
        Use a 2 pointer approach to solve this problem. We can skip a singular
        invalid character, except this invalid character could be either on the
        left or right side. Thus, when we do encounter an invalid char, we need
        to check both cases.

    Notes:
        This is a vanilla approach with the right intuition. We can definitely
        use built-in Python methods and shorthands to speed up runtime.
