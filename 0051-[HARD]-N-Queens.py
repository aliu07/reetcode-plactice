class Solution1:
    """
    Intuition:
        Our approach relies on placing a queen at each cell in a row and
        then moving onto the next row. If the queen we place violates the
        rules of chess, then we backtrack to the previous row and have it
        place its queen in a different cell.

        We terminate once we have found a solution i.e. all queens have
        been placed.

    Runtime:
        Checking if the newly placed queen is safe:
            - O(n) to check all rows
            - O(2 * (n - 1)) ~ O(n) for diagonals
            - O(n) overall

        Copying the solution and appending it to res:
            - O(n^2) to copy since we need to process each cell
            - There are at most n solutions possible
            - Overall O(n * n^2)

        DFS:
            - We have n rows
            - We can choose among n - q cells in our given row where q
              is the number of queens we have placed so far
            - Overall O(n!)

        The algorithm is either exploring or copying the solution, so
        the overall runtime is O(n * n!) + O(n * n^2) which is bounded
        by O(n!).

    Memory:
        O(n^2) for the board.

        O(2 * (n - 1)) ~ O(n) for the deque.

        Total O(n^2) memory.
