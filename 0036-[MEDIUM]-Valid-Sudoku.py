    Intuition:
        We can use hashing by row, column, and square (3x3 unit in the
        sudoku grid) to be able to perform fast lookups. The logic surrounding
        the squares requires some integer division math.

    Runtime:
        O(81) ~ O(1) since a sudoku is bounded as a 9x9 grid.

    Memory:
        Also O(1) since a sudoku is of a fixed size, meaning
        our hashsets have a defined upper bound.
