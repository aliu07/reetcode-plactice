    Intuition:
        We only ever need the previous row to build the next row. As
        such, we only need to keep track of a singular row at each
        iteration instaed of storing all previous rows in a hashset.

    Runtime:
        O(N ^ 2) where N = rowIndex. The outer loop requires rowIndex
        iterations. On the rowIndex'th row, we need rowIndex number of
        elements.

    Memory:
        O(N) where N = rowIndex since we are only tracking a singular
        current row at a time.
